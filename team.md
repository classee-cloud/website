## Team
Our core project team includes [Jonathan Bell](https://jonbell.net/), [Michael Hilton](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/), [Christopher Timperly](http://www.christimperley.co.uk) and [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/). This project represents the evolution of our studies of the challenges in artifact sharing [[ESE 21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-09973-5)], community work within ACM SIGSOFT, experiences as artifact co-chairs [[PLDI 20](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2020-PLDI-Research-Artifacts)], research in continuous integration [[MSR 20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3379597.3387460), [ESEC/FSE 19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3338906.3338922), [MSR 18](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3196398.3196422), [ESEC/FSE 17](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3106237.3106270), [ASE 16](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2970276.2970358)], and experiences creating many large-scale software engineering experiments [[ICSE 22](https://www.jonbell.net/preprint/confetti.pdf), [ICSE 21](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402098), [OOPSLA 20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428270), [ASE 18](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3238147.3238183), [ICSE 18](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3180155.3180164)].

Our prototypes for CLASSEE.cloud are made possible thanks to close collaborations with Northeastern's [Research Computing](https://rc.northeastern.edu) and [Khoury Systems](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/life-at-khoury/systems/) groups, who have provided technical expertise and hardware.

Our ultimate goal is to create a community resource to share resuable continuous integration workflows and actions, allowing researchers to quickly create large-scale evaluation scripts that can run on existing cloud or on-premises resources. We will build template workflows for common evaluation methodologies and datasets, allowing researchers to focus on designing and building their tools, rather than designing and building reusable artifacts for evaluating their tools. We hope to have more to share soon. In the meantime, if you are interested in collaborating on this project, please reach out to us at [team@classee.cloud](mailto:team@classee.cloud).
